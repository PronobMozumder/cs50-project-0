                        Bangladesh’s heavy dependence on agriculture has long contributed to seasonal unemployment among
                        rural farmworkers, as well as to a generally low standard of living in many areas. To counteract
                        this imbalance, a policy of industrialization was adopted in the mid-20th century. During the
                        period of Pakistani administration (1947–71), priority was given to industries based on
                        indigenous raw materials such as jute, cotton, hides, and skins.
                        The principle of free enterprise in the private sector was accepted, subject to certain
                        conditions, including the national ownership of public utilities. The industrial policy also
                        aimed to develop the production of consumer goods as quickly as possible in order to avoid
                        dependence on imports.

                        Bangladesh has remained largely agricultural, with nearly half the population employed in this
                        sector in the early 21st century. Rice is the predominant agricultural product, but jute and
                        tea, both of which are key sources of foreign exchange, also are important. Indeed, the country
                        is one of the world’s leading suppliers of raw jute. Other major agricultural products include
                        wheat; pulses, such as peas, beans, and lentils; sweet potatoes; oilseeds and spices of various
                        kinds; sugarcane; tobacco; and fruits, such as bananas, mangoes, and pineapples. The country
                        also is a leading producer of goat milk and goat meat.

                        Agriculture was at one time wholly dependent upon the vagaries of the monsoon; a poor monsoon
                        always meant poor harvests and the threat of famine. To reduce the risk of crop failure as a
                        result of such adverse weather conditions, a number of irrigation projects—including the
                        construction of dams—have been undertaken to control floods and to conserve rainwater for use in
                        the dry months.</p>

                        Among the most important of these initiatives have been the Karnaphuli Multipurpose Project in
                        the southeast, the Tista Barrage Project in the north, and the Ganges-Kabadak Project, to serve
                        the southwestern part of the country. Economic planning has encouraged double and triple
                        cropping, intercropping, and the increased use of fertilizers.
