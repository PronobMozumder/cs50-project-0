                        The riverine country of Bangladesh (“Land of the Bengals”) is one of the most densely populated
                        countries in the world, and its people are predominantly Muslim. As the eastern portion of the
                        historical region of Bengal, the area once formed, along with what is now the Indian state of
                        West Bengal, the province of Bengal in British India. With the partition of India in 1947, it
                        became the Pakistani province of East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan), one of five
                        provinces of Pakistan, separated from the other four by 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of Indian
                        territory. In 1971 it became the independent country of Bangladesh, with its capital at Dhaka.

                        Bangladesh is bordered by the Indian states of West Bengal to the west and north, Assam to the
                        north, Meghalaya to the north and northeast, and Tripura and Mizoram to the east. To the
                        southeast, it shares a boundary with Myanmar (Burma). The southern part of Bangladesh opens into
                        the Bay of Bengal.

                        The Barind is a somewhat elevated triangular wedge of land that lies between the floodplains of
                        the upper Padma and Jamuna rivers in northwestern Bangladesh. A depression called the Bhar Basin
                        extends southeast from the Barind for about 100 miles (160 km) to the confluence of the Padma
                        and Jamuna. This area is inundated during the summer monsoon season, in some places to a depth
                        exceeding 10 feet (3 metres). The drainage of the western part of the basin is centred in the
                        vast marshy area called the Chalan wetlands, also known as Chalan Lake. The floodplains of the
                        Jamuna, which lie north of the Bhar Basin and east of the Barind, stretch from the border with
                        Assam in the north to the confluence of the Padma and Jamuna in the south. The area is dominated
                        by the Jamuna, which frequently overflows its banks in devastating floods. South of the Bhar
                        Basin is the floodplain of the lower Padma.


                        In north-central Bangladesh, east of the Jamuna floodplains, is the Madhupur Tract. It consists
                        of an elevated plateau on which hillocks ranging in height from 30 to 60 feet (9 to 18 metres)
                        give contour to cultivated valleys. The Madhupur Tract contains sal trees, whose hardwood is
                        comparable in value and utility to teak. East of the Madhupur Tract, in northeastern Bangladesh,
                        is a region called the Northeastern Lowland. It encompasses the southern and southwestern parts
                        of the Sylhet area (including the valley plain of the Surma River) and the northern part of the
                        Mymensingh area and has a large number of lakes. The Sylhet Hills in the far northeast of the
                        region consist of a number of hillocks and hills ranging in elevation from about 100 feet (30
                        metres) to more than 1,100 feet (330 metres).

                        In east-central Bangladesh the Brahmaputra River in its old course (the Old Brahmaputra River)
                        built up the flood basin of the Meghna River, the region that includes the low and fertile
                        Meghna-Sitalakhya Doab (the land area between those rivers). This area is enriched by the Titas
                        distributary, and land areas are formed and changed by the deposition of silt and sand in the
                        riverbeds of the Meghna River, especially between Bhairab Bazar and Daudkandi. Dhaka is located
                        in this region.

                        extensive lakes
                        in the central part of the Bengal Delta, to the south of the upper Padma. The basin’s total area
                        is about 1,200 square miles (3,100 square km). The belt of land in southwestern Bangladesh
                        bordering the Bay of Bengal constitutes the Immature Delta. A lowland of some 3,000 square miles
                        (7,800 square km), the belt contains, in addition to the vast mangrove forest known as the
                        Sundarbans, the reclaimed and cultivated lands to the north of it. The area nearest the Bay of
                        Bengal is crisscrossed by a network of streams that flow around roughly oblong islands. The
                        Active Delta, located north of the Central Delta Basins and east of the Immature Delta, includes
                        the Dhaleswari-Padma Doab and the estuarine islands of varying sizes that are found from the
                        Pusur River in the southwest to the island of Sandwip near Chittagong in the southeast.

                        Lying to the south of the Feni River in southeastern Bangladesh is the Chittagong region, which
                        has many hills, hillocks, valleys, and forests and is quite different in aspect from other parts
                        of the country. The coastal plain is partly sandy and partly composed of saline clay; it extends
                        southward from the Feni River to the town of Cox’s Bazar and varies in width from 1 to 10 miles
                        (1.6 to 16 km). The region has a number of offshore islands and one coral reef, St. Martin’s,
                        off the coast of Myanmar. The hilly area known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts, in the far
                        southeast, consists of low hills of soft rocks, mainly clay and shale. The north-south ranges
                        are generally below 2,000 feet (600 metres) in elevation.

                <h2>Administrative geography</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Bangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions, each named after their respective
                    divisional headquarters: Barisal (officially Barishal[164]), Chittagong (officially
                    Chattogram[164]), Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.

                    Divisions are subdivided into districts (zila). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further
                    subdivided into upazila (subdistricts) or thana. The area within each police station, except for
                    those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several unions, with each union consisting of multiple
                    villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further
                    divided into mahallas.

                    There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is
                    composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a
                    chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats
                    (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.
