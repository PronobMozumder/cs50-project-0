            Although Bangladesh has existed as an independent country only since the late 20th century, its national
            character within a broader South Asian context dates to the ancient past. The country’s history, then, is
            intertwined with that of India, Pakistan, and other countries of the area. The land of Bangladesh, mainly a
            delta formed by the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and the Jamuna (Brahmaputra) rivers in the northeastern portion
            of the Indian subcontinent, is protected by forests to the west and a myriad of watercourses in the centre.
            As such, it was long the inaccessible frontier beyond the north Indian plain and therefore was home to a
            distinctive regional culture. In early times a number of independent principalities flourished in the
            region—called Bengal—including Gangaridai, Vanga, Gauda, Pundra, and Samatata, among others. In the 14th
            century Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah was instrumental in unifying many of these principalities. The Mughals added
            more territories, including Bihar and Orissa (now states of India), to constitute Suba Bangalah, which the
            British colonial administration later called the Bengal Presidency. In 1947, when British colonial rule
            ended, a downsized province of Bengal was partitioned into East Bengal and West Bengal. East Bengal was
            renamed East Pakistan in 1955, and in 1971 it became Bangladesh.

          <p class="text-justify">From the 3rd century BCE Buddhism flourished as the Mauryan emperors extended their
            influence in Bengal. Under the Gupta kings, who reigned from the early 4th to the late 6th century CE,
            Hinduism reestablished its hold, but Buddhism did not fully disappear. The two religions coexisted under the
            Pala (8th–12th century) dynasty, as well as under the Chandra (10th–11th century) dynasty in the southeast.
            By the end of the 11th century, the Senas, who were strongly Hindu, had gained control over a large part of
            Bengal.

            As early as the 9th century, Arab traders had taken Islam to Bengal. About 1200, Muslim invaders from the
            northwest overthrew the Senas. Muslim rule culminated in the Mughal dynasty (16th–18th century). In eastern
            Bengal, as in much of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, Islam became the religion of the
            majority.

            Muslim rule in Bengal promoted a society that was not only pluralistic but also syncretic to some degree.
            The rulers largely remained uninterested in preaching religion; rather, they concentrated on incorporating
            local communities into the state system. In their administration, high office holders, influential traders,
            eminent literati, and musicians came from diverse religious traditions. Nevertheless, practitioners of
            Sufism (mystical Islam) and Muslim saints did indeed preach Islam, and Muslim settlers received patronage.
            Although high-caste Hindus received land grants under early Muslim rule, under the Mughals most grants were
            awarded to Muslim settlers. These settlers developed an agrarian economy in Bengal that ultimately helped
            the spread of Islam. Meanwhile, the extensive interaction between Islam and Hinduism was reflected in social
            behaviour and the flourishing of various cults, notably that of the Hindu saint Caitanya (1486–1533). In
            contrast to more orthodox forms of Hinduism, the Caitanya sect—like Islam—was open to all members of
            society, regardless of caste or social rank.

            Under the Mughals the political boundaries of Bengal expanded to become Suba Bangalah (the Province of
            Bengal), and economic activity increased.
