                                Bangladesh time.
                                SpaceX, on May 11, launched the high-orbit communications satellite for Bangladesh to a
                                geostationary transfer orbit roughly 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers) above Earth.
                                The launching of the satellite was hailed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a
                                livestream video from Dhaka aired on SpaceX's launch webcast.

                                For the fourth time in a row, Bangladesh held the top position among South Asian
                                countries in ensuring gender equality.
                                The country has slipped only one notch down to the 48th position among 149 countries
                                worldwide, but is still ahead of all
                                other countries in Asia except the Philippines,according to World Economic Forum's 'The
                                Global Gender Gap Report 2018' published
                                on December 20.

                                The Bangladesh economy is charging towards record growth figure for the second
                                consecutive year, driven by double-digit growth in manufacturing and construction
                                sectors.

                                GDP growth in fiscal 2017-18 is likely to be 7.65 percent, up from 7.28 percent a year
                                earlier, as per the estimate of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.

                                This is the third consecutive year that the economic growth was above 7 percent after
                                years of languishing in the neighbourhood of 6 percent.

                                financing (AML/CTF) index of the Basel Institute on Governance -- a development that
                                will come as a pat on the back for the government.
                                The country came in at No. 82 out of 146 in the 2017 edition of the Basel AML Index, up

                        Among the most important of these initiatives have been the Karnaphuli Multipurpose Project in
                        the southeast, the Tista Barrage Project in the north, and the Ganges-Kabadak Project, to serve
                        the southwestern part of the country. Economic planning has encouraged double and triple
                        cropping, intercropping, and the increased use of fertilizers.
