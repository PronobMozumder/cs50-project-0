            While Bangladesh’s constitution of 1972 specifies a parliamentary form of government under a prime minister
            and a president elected by a national assembly,
            its implementation has been interrupted by coups. In 1975 a military coup led to a regime of martial law,
            and, though the form of government that followed was a mixture of presidential and parliamentary systems,
            power effectively remained with the army. The country experienced additional upsets and periods of martial
            law in the 1980s, but in 1991 a parliamentary system was restored, with a president as head of state and a
            prime minister as head of government.

            The parliament of Bangladesh, called the Jatiya Sangsad (House of the Nation), is a unicameral entity
            consisting of some 350 seats, most of which are filled through direct election. The remaining seats are
            reserved for women; these members are elected by the parliament itself. Legislators serve five-year terms.
            The parliament elects the president, who also serves a five-year term, with a two-term limit. The president
            then appoints the leader of the legislative majority party (or coalition) as prime minister.

            Between the early 1980s and the early 1990s, local government in Bangladesh underwent a large-scale
            administrative reorganization to decentralize power. The resulting structure consisted of several major
            divisions, each of which was subdivided into a number of districts, called zila. These districts were
            parceled further into smaller units, called upzila and thana. Bangladesh now consists of 8 divisions, more
            than 60 districts, and more than 500 upzila and thana. Villages—the smallest unit of government—numbered in
            the tens of thousands and were grouped into unions beneath the upzila and thana.
